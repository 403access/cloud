## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm i
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npx cloud dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

## Deployment

Start the Cloud shell:

```sh
npx cloud deploy {stage}
```
e.g. `npx cloud deploy dev`
