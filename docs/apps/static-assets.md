# Static Assets

Serverless Cloud allows you to serve files from your application URL. This is useful for serving static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing you to host front-end apps and websites. By convention, static assets must be stored in the `static` directory at the root of your application.

API routes take precedence over static assets and will be served first.
