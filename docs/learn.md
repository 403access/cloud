# Build *better faster*, with Serverless Cloud

## How it works
Serverless Cloud uses a familiar *Express.js-like* API to allow developers to quickly build REST APIs, create scheduled tasks, access data, and more. Using our lightweight command line tool, we monitor your local directory as you code, and then instanteously sync those changes to your own, fully-isolated **personal development instance**, giving you a high-fidelity cloud environment to test updates in a rapid feedback loop. Plus, you have your own copy of Serverless Data to work with, letting you test your data-driven applications without affecting other team members or production instances.

## Why it matters

The cloud is immensely powerful, but also complex and filled with lots of moving parts. Developers are now wearing more hats than ever before, not only building and designing software, but becoming cloud architects that need to understand countless cloud services, scalable data engines, fault tolerance, and so much more. The goal of Serverless Cloud is to reduce this complexity by focusing on interpretation instead of configuration, and by automatically applying best practices to common use cases, removing the need for all the boilerplate and configuration, and allowing developers to do what they do best: build software.
